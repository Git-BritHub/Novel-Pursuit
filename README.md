## Description
Novel Pursuit is a refactored Google Books API search engine. While originally built with a RESTful API, I have refactored it to be a GraphQL API, built with Apollo Server. This application uses MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server. With Novel Pursuit, the user can search for their desired books and save them to their profile. 


## Installation
1. Clone my respository by inputting the following in your terminal: `git clone https://github.com/Git-BritHub/Novel-Pursuit.git`.
2. When cloning is complete, input `cd Novel-Pursuit`.
3. Next, install the needed package dependencies by running `npm i` in the client, server, and root directory.
4. Important: to keep your site secure, create and set up your `.env` file for your secret key and expiration key in the root directory.
5. Once your `.env` file is created, make sure to set up your SECRET and EXPIRATION keys. 

## Usage
1. Input `npm run develop` in your terminal to run program locally or visit deployed website at novel-pursuit-production.up.railway.app
